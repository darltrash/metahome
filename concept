Rendering:
    Every quad is stored into a vertex buffer as 4 preprocessed
    vertices, each vertex is in clip space and gets rendered 
    directly into screen space, zero matrix transformations.

    The vertex buffer has a fixed size of elements and the index 
    buffer is always the same, as every object is a quad.

    If the processed vertices do not fit in clip space, those get 
    skipped altogether and the vertex space gets occupied by 
    something else.

    The vertex shader is as simple as it can be, and it will
    try to stay the same way, probably forever since it aims
    to work in Mali 400 systems, which have a very limited
    vertex shader instruction buffer.

    The scale is gotten automatically for the game depending on
    window size, and ensures that the main game elements are
    always visible.

    Each tile is chunked to discriminate non-visible tiles
    without having to iterate through each tile.
