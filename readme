An experimental game about experimentation in games, a journey into my mind.

This game is nothing but a tech demo right now, but it's getting there :)

REQUIREMENTS:
    Linux*:
        - the X11 dev libraries (I am profusely sorry, wayland users)
        - the ALSA dev libraries
        - a GLES2-capable GPU (most are GLES2-capable)
    
    MacOS:
        - MacOS core development libraries 
        - a Metal-capable device

    Windows:
        - Windows development libraries
        - a DirectX 11 capable system 
            (if you can run Windows 7, you already have this)

    Web:
        Not possible yet, since sokol_app.h and others require special
        macros and libraries from emscripten, which are planned to be 
        integrated into zig, an issue was made here:
            https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/10836

    All:
        - Zig 0.11.0 
        - a lot of love and patience :)

    -- NOTE --
        Linux* refeers to most Linux-like systems out there, which
        includes systems such as FreeBSD.

HOW TO BUILD AND RUN:
    BUILD MAPS:
        They come precompiled most of the time, so only do this if
        you have modified the maps in any way.

        The maps are done through LDTK and they need a functional
        Lua5.1+ install and a functional unix-like OS.

        - Clone this repo
        - run "zig build maps"
        - that's it :)

    RUN DEBUG:
        - Clone this repo
        - run "zig build run"
        - that's it :)

    EXPORT:
        - Clone this repo
        - run "zig build -Drelease-small=true"
        - the binary will be at zig-out/bin/metahome :)

        For cross-compiling, you can use the "-Dtarget=" flag for Zig:
            https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Targets

DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY:
    I have been struggling with ADHD for a long while and i have wanted to follow a programming philosophy 
    i call "first trashcode, then refine", which means that this code is utter garbage and it's like 
    that in purpose, so before anyone points something like "HEY U HAEV A CODEIGN PORBELM" out,
    consider that this is nothing but a DEMO of what's coming up next (which will also be open source).

    in resume: this code is garbage and i will fix it later, deal with it.
